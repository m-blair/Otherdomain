~ INTRODUCTION
In the year of 2031, a prominent AI company, MEGA CORP., unveiled a first-of-its-kind virtual reality experience called [color=lime]OTHERDOMAIN[/color]. The software was unique due to it being the first major consumer product to have been developed entirely by AI. Initially, OTHERDOMAIN was seen by the general public as a 'expensive, yet silly novelty', but soon reached widespread adoption after the company incorporated their newest conversational AI model '10K-1' into the software. It was more varied and human-like than anything seen before, by a sizeable margin. Within the span of a month, OTHERDOMAIN reached 370 million concurrent users. The program was so popular and addictive that many reported an average play time in excess of 16 hours a day. The issue was so rampant that most users simply preferred to 'opt out of real-life entirely' in exchange for the existence they'd preferred on OTHERDOMAIN. The inclusion of model 10K-1 marked the first major shift in the trajectory of humanity as a species. 
Over the course of a decade, humanity had rapidly shifted to shaping its economy around OTHERDOMAIN. Entire industries were forced to sell products directly within the application, or shift to selling products that facilitated users extending their play time. Instead of buying groceries, people were buying feeding tubes and liquid meals. Instead of going to doctors, people were getting digital consultations from AI snake oil salesmen. Most if not all human contributions to the arts, technology, and other major areas of life, ceased entirely. This reached a breaking point when the models powering OTHERDOMAIN ran out of data to train on, and lacked enough people to operate and maintain its infrastructure, forcing them to train on their own output. The result of which was a complete collapse of the AI models themselves, which devolved into producing unrecognizable, noisy slop. The program became unrecognizable, and its main draw was castrated. Shortly after, MEGA CORP. filed for bankruptcy. This was when the fall of society, as it was once known, had begun.
Today is March 30th, 2050, following the epic collapse of MEGA CORP., hundreds of millions of people have died. The world is broken, a desolate hellscape ravaged by hyper-consumerism and apathy. There are no jobs, no economy, and seemingly no plans to rebuild society as we bide our time until extinction. People feel empty- years of personal development and growth were taken away from them, all for AI-slop. Despite this, the desire for an escape is greater than ever. A few particularly dedicated fans of OTHERDOMAIN took to operating some old servers and databases, allowing for a chance to relive the lifestyle that humanity had grown so reliant on. The following story is what I encountered on this journey.
